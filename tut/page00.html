            <p>
                The story begins with a Triangle named Brick and a Bird named
                Ada introducing themselves to each other.

            <p>
                Both of them are out on a walk, and Ada happens to recognize
                Brick because they live across the street from each other.
            </p>

            <p>
                It turns out that Ada and Brick are both looking for sticks to
                use as building materials. Ada is repairing its nest, and Brick
                is learning to build furniture. They start talking about their
                creative process.
            </p>

            <p>
                After Ada has collected the required sticks, it mentions it
                needs to start heading home soon. Brick offers to walk it back
                to continue the conversation, but Ada begins to bristle at the
                idea of showing Brick its nest.
