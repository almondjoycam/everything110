                The story begins with a Triangle named Brick and a Bird named
                Ada introducing themselves to each other.

                What a lovely day to be outside~
            </p>
            <p class="narr" aria-label="Story Narration">
                Both of them are out on a walk, and Ada happens to recognize
                Brick because they live across the street from each other.
            </p>

                Hey, isn't that the Triangle from the other side of the road?
            </p>
            <p class="narr" aria-label="Story Narration">
                It turns out that Ada and Brick are both looking for sticks to
                use as building materials. Ada is repairing its nest, and Brick
                is learning to build furniture. They start talking about their
                creative process.
            </p>
            <img src="/everything110/img/brick-3.svg" alt="Thinking Brick" />
            <p class="dial" aria-label="Brick's Dialogue">
                I'm working on something new that requires a lot of Sticks to be
                woven together. It's very challenging!
            </p>
            <p class="narr" aria-label="Story Narration">
                After Ada has collected the required sticks, it mentions it
                needs to start heading home soon. Brick offers to walk it back
                to continue the conversation, but Ada begins to bristle at the
                idea of showing Brick its nest.

                You can't just <em>ask</em> to walk into someone's home!

                <p>
                    Objects come in all different types!
                    If Ada and Brick are both looking for Sticks,
                    then handing them a Shape wouldn't do anything!
                    The <em>type</em> of an object determines
                    almost all of the things it knows about itself,
                    as well as how others can interact with it.
