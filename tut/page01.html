            <h1>01: Secrets</h1>

            <p>
                Brick is confused that Ada is becoming upset, and asks what
                happened. Ada relaxes a bit, and explains that it feels very
                protective of its nest and doesn't want anything in it shown to
                anyone outside its family.
            </p>

            <p>
                This helps Brick understand, but it still doesn't want to leave
                quite yet. Brick asks Ada if it might accompany it elsewhere,
                and Ada mentions it was planning on visiting a friend down by
                the pond.
            </p>

            <p>
                While they are walking towards the pond, Ada becomes curious
                about Brick's color. Ada wonders if Brick can change color at
                will, or if it can tell its own color. Ada asks Brick if it can
                become the same color as Ada's feathers, and Brick replies that
                red is its color and its color is red, that's how it got its
                name, and this cannot be changed.
            </p>
            <img src="/everything110/img/sprites_4.png" alt="Serious Brick" />
            <p>
                Ada is somewhat disappointed because it always considered red an
                angry color. It didn't want a friend who was always angry. Brick
                thinks about this for a moment, and then replies that it has a
                full range of emotions - excited, confused, upset, and so many
                more! Plus, these change all the time by both internal and
                external factors. In fact, Ada is making Brick excited right now
                because they are new friends.
