                Brick is confused that Ada is becoming upset, and asks what
                happened. Ada relaxes a bit, and explains that it feels very
                protective of its nest and doesn't want anything in it shown to
                anyone outside its family.
            </p>
            <img src="/everything110/img/ada-3.svg" alt="Pensive Ada" />
            <p class="dial" aria-label="Ada's Dialogue">
                My nest is special to me, and I don't like anyone else to see it
                unless I have invited them first.
            </p>
            <p class="narr" aria-label="Story Narration">
                This helps Brick understand, but it still doesn't want to leave
                quite yet. Brick asks Ada if it might accompany it elsewhere,
                and Ada mentions it was planning on visiting a friend down by
                the pond.
            </p>

            <p class="dial" aria-label="Ada's Dialogue">
                I was just about to head down to the pond to see a friend, would
                you like to join me?
            </p>
            <p class="narr" aria-label="Story Narration">
                While they are walking towards the pond, Ada becomes curious
                about Brick's color. Ada wonders if Brick can change color at
                will, or if it can tell its own color. Ada asks Brick if it can
                become the same color as Ada's feathers, and Brick replies that
                red is its color and its color is red, that's how it got its
                name, and this cannot be changed.
            </p>
            <img src="/everything110/img/brick-4.svg" alt="Serious Brick" />
            <p class="dial" aria-label="Brick's Dialogue">
                I can't just change my color like that! It's always been like that.
                Plus, I think it's pretty cool~
            </p>
            <p class="narr" aria-label="Story Narration">
                Ada is somewhat disappointed because it always considered red an
                angry color. It didn't want a friend who was always angry. Brick
                thinks about this for a moment, and then replies that it has a
                full range of emotions - excited, confused, upset, and so many
                more! Plus, these change all the time by both internal and
                external factors. In fact, Ada is making Brick excited right now
                because they are new friends.

            <p class="dial" aria-label="Brick's Dialogue">
                It's not that my color defines my personality. I like to think that
                my personality defines my color, actually!
