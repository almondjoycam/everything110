            <h1>04: Details</h1>

            <p>
                Fiddler allows Marble and Spruce in with pleasure. "Welcome in,
                my dear rectangles!" it says as it gestures grandly with three
                of its legs into its abode.
            </p>
            <img src="/everything110/img/sprites_10.png" alt="Fiddler welcomes the new guests in" />
            <p>
                Marble excitedly wheels into the main room. "Thank you so much
                for having us over! I'm Marble, pleased to meet you!"
            </p>
            <img src="/everything110/img/sprites_13.png" alt="Marble the Rectangle" />
            <p>
                Spruce, however, stops for a moment in the doorway. "I'm sorry,
                but I'm actually a square. My name is Spruce. Thank you for the
                invitation."
            </p>
            <img src="/everything110/img/sprites_20.png" alt="Spruce feels displeased" />
            <p>
                Fiddler chuckles once again and says, "I know, I know. But it
                wouldn't be very efficient of me to call you all by the name of
                your most specific group, would it now? And besides, a square is
                just a very special kind of rectangle anyway, my dear Spruce."
            </p>
            <img src="/everything110/img/sprites_9.png" alt="Fiddler talking pleasantly" />
            <p>
                Spruce pauses in contemplation. "I- I guess that's true, I never
                thought about it like that..." It turns to Marble. "Does that
                mean I can do the same kinds of things tha you can?"
            </p>
            <img src="/everything110/img/sprites_19.png" alt="Dazed Spruce" />
            <p>
                Marble grins and replies, "That's right - only you get to do
                everything with the same side length, instead of having to keep
                track of two different ones."
            </p>
            <img src="/everything110/img/sprites_13.png" alt="Marble the Rectangle" />
            <p>
                Fiddler chimes in: "Well, that's not quite it. It's true that
                Spruce has all the same side lengths, yes. But Spruce is just
                like you if you made one side length equal to the other, no? And
                take our dear Brick as well - it has three different side
                lengths!"
            </p>
            <img src="/everything110/img/sprites_11.png" alt="Fiddler ponders" />
            <p>
                Brick begins to understand, and exclaims, "That's because we're
                all Shapes - we have sides, and area, and perimeters - but
                different kinds of Shapes do different things with them."
            </p>
