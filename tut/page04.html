                I know, I know. But it wouldn't be very efficient of me to call
                you all by the name of your most specific group, would it now?
                And besides, a square is just a very special kind of rectangle

                That's right &ndash; only you get to do everything with the same
                side length, instead of having to keep track of two different
                ones.

                Well, that's not quite it. It's true that Spruce has all the
                same side lengths, yes. But Spruce is just like you if you made
                one side length equal to the other, no? And take our dear Brick
                as well &ndash; it has three different side lengths!

                After hearing this, Brick suddenly starts to understand, and

                That's because we're all Shapes! We have sides, and area, and
                perimeters, but different kinds of Shapes do different things
                with them.

                    Marble, Spruce, and Brick all are members of a bigger
                    group: Shapes. Because of this, they have quite a bit in
                    common. Just like how siblings from the same parents can
                    share features with each other, objects from the same larger
                    group share information and methods. This is called
                    <em>inheritance</em>.
