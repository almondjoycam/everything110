            <p class="narr" aria-label="Story Narration">
                After having much lively conversation between the three of them,
                Fiddler notices that time has passed and it's almost time to eat
                dinner. Ada and Brick both get really excited about having
                dinner together.
            </p>
            <img src="/everything110/img/fiddler-1.svg" alt="Restful Fiddler" />
            <p class="dial" aria-label="Fiddler's Dialogue">
                I don't mean to interrupt, but are you kids getting hungry?
            </p>
            <p class="narr" aria-label="Story Narration">
                Brick feels the atmosphere could be livened even further with a
                few more friends, and asks Fiddler and Ada if they would be okay
                if it asked some Shape friends to join them.
            </p>
            <img
                src="/everything110/img/brick-3.svg"
                alt="Brick asking a question" />
            <p class="dial" aria-label="Brick's Dialogue">
                What would you say to maybe inviting a few more?
            </p>
            <p class="narr" aria-label="Story Narration">
                Ada and Fiddler both agree with the sentiment "the more, the
                merrier!" A few minutes later, Marble, a rectangle who uses a
                wheelchair, and Spruce, a square who doesn't appear very expressive,
                arrive with a knock at Fiddler's door.
            </p>

            <aside class="concept" aria-label="Concept Aside">
                <h2>Connect to Concepts:<br />Methods</h2>
                <p>
                    We've seen that Ada and Brick can sometimes see each other's
                    information, but what if one of them tried to do something that
                    only the other can do? <em>Methods</em> are actions that are
                    specific to each object, and because of this, only the object
                    with the method can perform such an action. So, Brick can't
                    invite friends to Fiddler's house by itself, but it can ask
                    nicely!
