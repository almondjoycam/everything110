                Marble and Spruce contemplate for a bit, and decide they want

                together a mixture with all kinds of Nuts, including its
                favorite, Almonds. They all sit down to enjoy in good spirits.

                    Ada got really upset when Brick couldn't decide what kind of
                    food to make for its friends. Like food, there are lots of
                    groups that have members, but can't exist by themselves.
                    When a group provides a template but can't exist without its
                    members, that's called an
                    <em>abstract</em> group. Luckily, the members of the Food
                    group all have their own clear, or <em>concrete</em>,
                    information.
