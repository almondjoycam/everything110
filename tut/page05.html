            <h1>05: Dinnertime</h1>

            <p>
                Ada rejoins the conversation, a little impatiently. "Are we
                about ready to eat? What are we having?" it asks.
            </p>
            <img src="/everything110/img/sprites_7.png" alt="Ada thinking about dinner" />
            <p>
                Brick replies, "I got no idea, I just want some Food. Any Food
                will do."
            </p>
            <img src="/everything110/img/sprites_4.png" alt="Brick doesn't know" />
            <p>
                Ada is not satisfied with this response, and argues that Food is
                not a solid concept to even make. Does Fiddler know a plain Food
                recipe? Of course not.
            </p>
            <img src="/everything110/img/sprites_8.png" alt="Ada didn't like that" />
            <p>
                Fiddler chimes in after being mentioned - "Now, now, little
                bird, we have lots of kinds of Food. What would you or your
                friends like, hmm?"
            </p>
            <img src="/everything110/img/sprites_11.png" alt="Fiddler ponders" />
            <p>
                Marble and Spruce contemplate for a bit, and decide they want
                something with Nuts. Ada likes this idea a lot, and Fiddler puts
                together a mixture with all kinds of Nuts, including its
                favorite, Almonds. They all sit down to enjoy in good spirits.
