            <h1>Everything Is An Object!</h1>

            <p>
                Everything you see in the world around you is something that
                knows who it is and what it can do! Follow along with the story
                of Ada, Brick, and their friends to find out what each of them
                knows.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the world of computer code, the writer often wraps up each
                individual part of the program in a neat little "object." But
                sometimes, it gets hard to understand what each one knows how to
                do. The characters and settings in this story all act as
                "objects" of their own to introduce this concept.
            </p>

            <p>
                After reading through the story, you will get to learn more
                about each character and what group they belong to, as well as
                be directed towards other resources that put this concept of the
                "object" into specific languages you might be familiar with.
                There will also be longer articles available if you're feeling
                more ambitious.
            </p>
