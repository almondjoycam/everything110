                    Ada is a friendly Bird who is very protective of its family
                    and friends. It keeps its guard up around anyone new it
                    meets, but is very open to new connections despite this.
                    However, it can get easily annoyed. It lives in a Nest with
                    its family, and often collects Sticks in the region to
                    assist its family in repairing the Nest.

                    Brick is an excitable Triangle who recently has been
                    learning to make furniture. It has quite a few of these
                    Furnishings in its house, but some of the chairs look
                    questionably balanced. It spends most of its time to itself,
                    but occasionally gathers with its friends Marble and Spruce
                    about once a week.

                    Spruce is a reserved Square who tends not to express much
                    emotion. It relies on hand signals and verbal cues to
                    communicate the way it feels instead. It's living with
                    Marble, and appreciates when Marble can put feelings to
                    words faster than itself.
