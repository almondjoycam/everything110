                Camber is an Almond who loves to create. In fact, it created the
                idea for this entire story!
            </p>
            <p>
                Camber works with children 8-12 years old in Northern Virginia
                who are learning to make video games, but it noticed that many
                of them get lost when they have to work with "Objects." It
                decided to create a simple visual story that paralleled the idea
                of "Objects" in terms that were easier to understand.
            </p>
            <p>
                Camber is also learning to make websites like this one that can
                bring content to all manner of devices and readers. It really
                wants to make content on the internet accessible, no matter if
                it's being read aloud, tabbed through, simplified, or anything
                else that can help people all over the world understand things a
                little better.
            </p>
            <p>
                If there's something on this website that is hard to understand
                or easy to miss, let Camber know over in the
                <a href="/everything110/feedback.html">Feedback page</a>.
